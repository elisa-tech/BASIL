# BASIL

A tool developed to manage software related work items, design their traceability towards specifications and source code and ensure completeness of analysis.

It comes with a web user interface to provide a simplified view of work item relationships and with a REST api to simplify the integration in other toolchains.

## What is it for?

With BASIL you can decompose a Software Component Specification (or source code directly) in snippets and assign to each one a set of desired work items.

BASIL will help you on identifying gaps and on tracking progress.

## Differentiating Factors

- Web User Interface
- HTTP REST Api (to simplify integration in automated workflows)
- User management
- Granular user permissions (e.g restrict access to critical info or provide read account to an assessor)
- Manage multiple work items in the same place (see **Supported Work Items**)
- Reuse work items across software components and libraries
- Work items history and lifecycle (keep track of any changes and support work items states like new, in progress, in review, ...)
- Test Infratructure (To run your test and track results in the same place where you define requirements)
- Support multiple test environment (Container, Virtual Machines, Physical Hardwares)
- Trace tests executed on external test infrastructures (GitlabCI, Github Actions, Testing Farm, KernelCI)
- Collaboration (comments, notifications)
- Clarifies gaps (each relationship support a percentage of completeness)
- Impact analysis of specification changes and automatic fix of warnings
- Parallelize teams work (supporting multiple mapping views)
- Export traceability matrix in SPDX Model 3
- Import Software Requirements from multiple sources: SPDX Model3 json, yaml, json, csv, xlsx
- Import Test Cases from remote test repositories (via tmt)

## Supported Work Items

- Software Requirements
- Test Specifications
- Test Cases
- Test Runs
- Test Run Configurations
- Justifications
- Documents

## Test Infrastructure

BASIL comes with its own test infrastructure that allow users to run any kind of test case (written in any programming language)
against different kind of test environment, such as containers, virtual machines, physical hardwares.
That is possible thanks to a Test Management Tool (**tmt**), a python project that is using metadata files (**fmf** format) to describe test cases, test plans and user stories.
The metadata file is the abstraction layer BASIL needs to run any kind of test case.
**tmt** is also able to provision different kind of test environment, as the one above listed.

## Trace test executed on external infrastructures

BASIL is also able to trace test cases executed on external test infrastructure such as

- KernelCI
- Testing Farm
- github actions
- gitlab CI

to test cases.

## DESIGN SBOM

BASIL supports the export of DESIGN SBOM based on SPDX Model 3 in JSON format.
It also supports the import of Software Requirements from SBOM exported from BASIL.

## How to run it

BASIL consists of 2 sub projects

- API - Python Flask backend
- APP - React Patternfly frontend

To run those applications, you can follow instructions provided into the [documentation](https://basil-the-fusa-spice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_run_it.html).
